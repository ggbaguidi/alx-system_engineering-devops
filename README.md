# ALX â€” System Engineering & DevOps Track

This repository contains exercises and projects for the ALX School "System Engineering & DevOps" curriculum. The content is organized into numbered modules that progressively teach shell basics, permissions, redirections, scripting, networking, web stack debugging, and more.

This README is intended to help you navigate the repository, run the exercises, follow conventions, and contribute changes.

## Repository layout

Top-level folders represent modules and topics. Each folder usually contains numbered exercise files. Typical structure (partial):

- `0x00-shell_basics/` â€” Basic shell commands and navigation exercises (e.g., `0-current_working_directory`, `1-listit`, ...).
- `0x01-shell_permissions/` â€” File and directory permissions, ownership, symbolic links, etc.
- `0x02-shell_redirections/` â€” Input/output redirection, pipes, file manipulation.
- `0x03-shell_variables_expansions/` â€” Shell variables, parameter expansion, arithmetic.
- `0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing/` â€” Looping, conditionals, parsing text.
- `0x05-processes_and_signals/` â€” Processes, job control, signals.
- `0x06-regular_expressions/` â€” Regex exercises with `grep`, `sed`, `awk`.
- `0x07-networking_basics/` and `0x08-networking_basics_2/` â€” Networking commands and basics.
- `0x09-web_infrastructure_design/` â€” Design-related tasks.
- `0x0C-web_server/`, `0x0F-load_balancer/`, `0x10-https_ssl/` â€” Web server and HTTPS configuration topics.
- `0x14-mysql/` â€” Database basics (MySQL) exercises.
- `attack_is_the_best_defense/` â€” Security-related exercises and labs.

Each exercise file is normally a shell script, a text file containing commands to run, or a small utility. Files are named with a leading number (or numbers) and a short descriptive name, which indicates exercise order.
